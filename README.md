# Internpe_Breast_Cancer_Detection
This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression for breast cancer detection using the Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn. 
The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant (0) or benign (1) based on various features such as mean radius, texture, and smoothness.
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
let's have a look how i achieved it...
